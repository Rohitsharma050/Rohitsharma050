# Hi there 👋, I'm Rohit Sharma

## 🚀 About Me

I am a Computer Science Engineering student and an aspiring Software Engineer who loves turning ideas into clean, efficient, and scalable code. I enjoy building real-world web applications, solving challenging DSA problems, and understanding how systems work under the hood. I believe in learning by building, collaborating with other developers, and continuously pushing my limits through hands-on projects and open-source-friendly practices.
